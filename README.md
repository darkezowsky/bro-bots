This project originally began during the GMTK Game Jam 2021.
Unfortunately, during the jam, we encountered several issues and made numerous mistakes.
About two hours before the submission deadline, we messed something up, and the project broke and stopped working.
We were unable to fix the problems in time, and ultimately, the project was never submitted for jury evaluation.
On June 13, 2021, the project was abandoned. Now, it's time to change that.

Main goals of the project:
* **Fixing the bugs** encountered during the GMTK Game Jam 2021 that caused the project to fail.
* **Refining or rewriting scripts** as needed to ensure better stability and performance.
* **Updating the game engine** to a more current version for access to newer features, bug fixes, and improved performance.
* **Improving and expanding mechanics** to enhance gameplay and add new features.
* **Completing and expanding the project**, with the ultimate goal of creating a fully playable build.
